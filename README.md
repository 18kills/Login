IOT device brute force login tool          
This program was made to check iot devices for comman passwords

###How it works    
This uses Hydra for brute forcing and pnscan for port scanning        
First checks the first ip for open ports 22 (ssh) and 23 (telnet)      
Then if it finds an open port and uses hydra to try to brute force the login        
Hydra logs everything into the login.log file         

###Instructions         
After this is downloaded run the setup file        
After that the program is ready to be used       
Run the login file to start the program
